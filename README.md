# Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) for Finance

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook demonstrating the application of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques for financial ratio analysis. The notebook was presented during workshops hosted by **InterviewClub** and **PM Mixer - The Product Club**.

## Overview

The notebook guides users through using RAG methods to extract and analyze financial data from Apple's 10-K report. By leveraging RAG, the notebook showcases how to enhance financial analysis with AI-driven insights, particularly focusing on key financial ratios.

## Key Features

- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):** Implementation of RAG techniques to retrieve relevant sections from Apple's 10-K document.
- **Integration of DeepSeek-R1:** Utilization of the DeepSeek-R1 model to enhance reasoning capabilities during analysis. DeepSeek-R1 excels in logical inference, mathematical reasoning, and real-time problem-solving, making it particularly suitable for tasks involving numerical data and complex financial computations.
- **Hands-on Example:** Practical demonstration using real-world data from Apple’s financial statements.

## Prerequisites

The notebook is designed to run on **Google Colab** to ensure compatibility and avoid breaking code. No local setup is required.

## How to Run

1. Open the notebook in Google Colab:

2. Follow the steps in the notebook to explore RAG techniques and financial ratio analysis.

## Dataset

The notebook uses Apple’s 10-K financial report as the primary data source. Ensure you have access to this document or follow the instructions in the notebook to retrieve it.
